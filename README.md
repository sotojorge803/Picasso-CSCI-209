# Picasso
Authors: Ryan Messick, Alex Sender, Jorge Soto-Ventura, Finn Thorne


An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

The `images` directory contains some sample images generated from Picasso.  Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.

## Extensions 

`Variables` - the variables are shown in a drop down list for combine when created.
 
`Combine` - The combine button allows the user to choose from a list variables and combine them using different variables. First by clicking the variables then clicking on which binary operator to combine them with. Finally click combine to show the new expression

`History` - To check the history of expressions used, Add a $ and the number of when the expression is used with 0 being the first expression.
